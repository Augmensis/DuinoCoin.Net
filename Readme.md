A simple C# .NET 5.0 library for Duino Coin. Feel free to fork the repo and submit pull requests for any new features you want to add.

Please raise any bugs and features as a new Issue/Ticket so that we can map them to pull requests where necessary.

Use the `dev` branch for the latest development updates. Create a new branch from it for any new features and delete them once a Merge Request has been accepted.

So far:
- A wrapper for .NET calls to the official DUCO REST API https://github.com/dansinclair25/duco-rest-api 
- Integration tests for the service to be notified of breaking changes from the API service.

TODO:
